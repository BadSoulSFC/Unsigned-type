# Unsigned-type

this is not going to be updated
"unsigned" variables can't be negative( < 0)
and there are problems with that in some stuff,
so I wanted to limit it and reset it to the number,
that has been set as limiter.
It'll do that if the number is higher than the limiter,
if it's not, it just outputs what you typed as Input value.


It's useless
